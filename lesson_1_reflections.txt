How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I could focus on the changes. The tools though, were not the prettiest

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I could learn when and how I decided on things. I would also have one main file, instead of million files

Manual commits
I would preffer automatic, intelligent ones. Or nano automatic ones and big manual ones

Multi-file commits:
Makes sense as many files are working together

Git log and diff
I can see what were the commits with log and diff between them to see the changes

Confidence
You can explore the state space more, as there is bigger chance that you can revert mistakes

How to use git
I use git to version control all my text files
